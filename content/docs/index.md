# yamd in 30 seconds

A folder of `.md` files. One `pages.yml`. That is the whole stack.

No build step. No bundler. No backend. No framework lock-in. Open the folder in any static host and you are done.

## The pitch

**Most docs platforms ask you to migrate.** yamd asks you to keep writing Markdown.

- Your content is just files. Grep them. Diff them. Move them.
- Your navigation is one YAML file. A junior dev can edit it.
- Your hosting is whatever serves static assets.

If you delete yamd tomorrow, your docs still exist as readable Markdown. **That is the entire promise.**

## What you get out of the box

- Multi-page docs site rendered in the browser.
- App shell with responsive menu bar, backdrop overlay, and a built-in light/dark theme toggle.
- Deterministic deep links and routing from `pages.yml`.
- Sidebar filter that narrows the tree as you type, routes to the first matching page (**`#` updates**), highlights page text, scrolls first hit, and supports next-hit jump with `Alt+N`.
- Optional Mermaid diagrams and Prism syntax highlighting, loaded only when needed.
- Static deploy to GitHub Pages, Netlify, S3, or your own nginx in minutes.

## Who this is for

- **Teams drowning in doc framework migrations.** Stop. Just write Markdown.
- **Projects that already speak Markdown.** Your README is already 80% of a docs site.
- **Maintainers who want boring infrastructure.** Static files do not page you at 3 AM.

## Who this is not for

- You need WYSIWYG editing, comments, and approval workflows. Use a CMS.
- You need server-side rendering for SEO-critical marketing pages. Use a real SSR framework.
- You need plugins, themes marketplaces, and a brand around your docs tool. Use the obvious ones.

We are honest about the trade. Boring is the feature.

## How this manual is organized

- **[Start here](#start)** is the entry path and reading flow.
- **[Get started](#docs/get-started)** runs the site locally and ships it.
- **[Information architecture](#docs/site-map)** maps URLs to files.
- **[Features and authoring model](#docs/features)** is the day-to-day writing reference.
- **[Architecture](#docs/architecture)** and **[Security model](#docs/security)** are the internals.

## Next step

You have read enough theory. **[Run it locally](#docs/get-started)** — it takes longer to read about than to do.
